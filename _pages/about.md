![The Family]({{ base_path }}/images/front/web/nous.jpg)

Weâ€™re an anglo-corsican family, living in the French alps, with three
children, the first aged 17, and 14 year old twins (in 2016).
 
 Jocelyne grew up in Corsica, an island in the Medditerranean that the
 French call "the isle of beauty", where we have a wonderful
 [holiday home](http://en.casa.albore.fr), Nick grew up in Bristol,
 UK, and works as a software architect.

We both share the love of traveling, and often do home exchanges
with either of our homes.
