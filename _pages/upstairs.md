{% include toc %}

More photos, this time of the top floor, with large central playroom, master bedroom with dressing room, leading into the bathroom (shower, bath, bidet, 2 sinks), and two other bedrooms.
This area is typically closed off when we rent the house out when
we’re in Corsica, but is normally left open when doing a home
exchange.
