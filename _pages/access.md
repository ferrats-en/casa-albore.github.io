## Getting around Grenoble

There is an excellent tram and bus service throughout Grenoble, and
also a city-bike rental system. There are park-and-ride car-parks on
the edge of town (nearest one to us is in Gieres) or you can drive
into town which is just over 20 minutes from the house.

## Public transport to/from our hamlet

The

bus runs almost hourly, Monday-Friday, and connects between Gieres (tram,
bus, railway station) and our home - actually, 1km from the house at the end of
our road.

The

at least 2 hours in advance, and which runs between Gieres (tram, bus,
railway station) and our hamlet, 100m from the house.
