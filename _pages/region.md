## Introduction

The house is in a mountain hamlet, surrounded by fields and forests,
and overlooks the Belledonne mountain range, which is one of the most
unspoiled of the alpine mountain ranges, with nearby skiing and other
mountain activities (hiking, cycling, cross-country skiing,
paragliding, ...)

There are many walks both from the doorstep and nearby. There are lots
of local activities including swimming, tennis, golf, the thermal
baths of Uriage, restaurants, etc. etc.

## Distances to nearby places (by car)

* 10 minutes from supermarkets / shops
* 15 minutes from the Grenoble University Campus
* 20 minutes from the center of Grenoble
* 20 minutes  from Chamrousse, the nearby ski station
* 30 minutes from the Synchrotron / ILL research centers
* 90 minutes from Lyon airport or Geneva airport.

Public transport is available almost hourly to and from
the hamlet Monday-Friday.

Our car is a 5-year-old Citroen Berlingo, which we can arrange to
exchange if doing a house swap. It's equipped with snow tires in the
winter, and we've got chains “just in case” when going to ski
stations. The roads around the house are very well cleared of snow in
the winter, we're not at a high altitude (610m) so only get significant snow
2 or 3 times in the year - although the snow in the fields and garden
can last a month or two, the roads are completely clear.

In the house we have many books with walks and other things to
do in the region, and a booklet we wrote for visitors with our
favourite local places and things to do / see.
