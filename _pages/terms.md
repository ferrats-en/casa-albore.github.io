When a reservation request is made, we will acknowledge the request
and send you a contract to be signed in double and returned within a
week together with a 25% deposit. The reservation will be cancelled if
we do not receive the contract and cheque on time (cheque can be in
UKP upon prior arrangement, and inter-bank transfer in the UK is also
acceptable).  The remainder of the rental fee must be paid one calendar
month prior to the start of the rental.
